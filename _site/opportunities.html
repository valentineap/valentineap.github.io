    <!-- Jump to opportunities for:
- [Undergraduates](#undergraduates)
- [Masters students](#masters-students)
- [PhD students](#phd-students)
- [Postdocs and other other staff](#postdocs-and-other-staff)

## Undergraduates ##
Level 3 and Level 4 dissertation projects are available for Durham undergraduates; please see the list distributed by the module convenor, or [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk). I am always happy to hear from Durham undergraduates who are keen to get involved in our research.

## Masters students ##

I offer research projects in the context of three Masters-level programmes run by Durham University:

- [MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis](https://miscada.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/) (MISCADA) &mdash; A one-year taught Masters, aimed at students with highly-numerate first degrees. A research project must be completed as part of this course.
- [MSc in Data Science](https://www.dur.ac.uk/science.faculty/mds/) (MDS) &mdash; A one-year taught Masters, suitable for quantitively-minded students whose first degrees are not necessarily in numerate subjects. A research project must be completed as part of this course.
- [MSc by Research](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/msc-in-computation-geoscience/) (MScR) &mdash; A one-year research degree. If none of my advertised projects match your interests, you are welcome to [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk) to discuss other possibilities.

Unfortunately, I do not have funding to offer financial support to students following these courses. Various scholarships are available: see the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/) and [University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/) websites for more details.



## PhD students ##

The following opportunities are currently open for applications:
- *Unfortunately, there are no positions advertised at present*

I cannot provide any financial support, except as detailed above. Various organisations in the UK and overseas offer scholarships for PhD studies, and I am always happy to hear from students who have secured one of these, or are contemplating making an application. Please [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk) to discuss possible projects. Further information about costs and some potential sources of funding can be found on the [Durham University website](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/), and information specific to the Department of Earth Sciences [can be found here](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/).


## Postdocs and other staff ##
We are currently recruiting for:
- [Scientific programmer](https://jobs.anu.edu.au/cw/en/job/540441/scientific-programmer) &mdash; *Closing date: 14 June 2021* &mdash; This position is based at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Unfortunately, we can only consider applicants who already have the right to live and work in Australia.

I am always very happy to hear from early career researchers who are considering applying for their own funding and who might be interested in coming to Durham to work with me. Please [get in touch](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk) to discuss the possibilities, and how I can support you through the application process. -->
