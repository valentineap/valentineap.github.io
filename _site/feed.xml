&lt;p&gt;Glass is everywhere around us. It lets light into your house, stores your food and drink, and decorates your home. It’s in the screen you are looking at right now; in next-generation batteries or medical implants; even in volcanoes. In fact, it’s one of the most important materials on our planet. It’s so important that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijag.12242&quot;&gt;Morse and Evenson&lt;/a&gt; proposed that we are living in the Glass Age. And by using deep learning with PyTorch, we can now understand glass better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;machine-learning-and-glass-design&quot;&gt;Machine learning and glass design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a glass, you need to melt something and then cool it very rapidly. In the molten liquid, atoms are disordered and move around freely. Normally, the process of solidification would involve the atoms reorganising into regular structures, known as crystals — but if the melt is cooled quickly enough, there isn’t time for this to occur. The result is a solid material that still has the atomic structure of a liquid: this is what we know as ‘glass’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/glass_structure.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Glass structure&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The structure of a glass is a frozen picture of that of its parental melt, with a disordered network of atoms (here a schematic network with two different types of atoms). Slow cooling allows rearrangements to occur, and usually leads to the formation of crystals with long-range atomic order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all glass is good for windows. It turns out that the physical properties of a glass depend on the chemical composition of the molten liquid we started with. By tweaking this composition, we can control the strength and transparency of the glass; how it reacts to chemicals; whether it conducts electricity. If we have a particular application in mind — perhaps a new smartphone screen — we can design a glass that meets our needs. However, this has always relied on an expensive and time-consuming process of experimentation, trial and error. Now, machine learning promises to revolutionise glass design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-melt--a-grey-box-multitask-model&quot;&gt;i-Melt : a grey-box multitask model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new work published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2021.08.023&quot;&gt;Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta&lt;/a&gt;, we present &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt&quot;&gt;i-Melt&lt;/a&gt; — a physics- and chemistry-informed deep neural network which can accurately predict glass properties based on the composition of the melt. i-Melt is a grey-box model: it embeds known physical equations and thermodynamic principles alongside learned relationships to ensure meaningful and realistic results. So far, we have focused on a group of glasses known as ‘aluminosilicates’ (which just means their main ingredients are oxides of aluminum and silicon). These are very common in a variety of natural and industrial settings. We train i-Melt using a database of experimental observations across a variety of compositions, and obtain a model that can predict a wide range of properties including melt viscosity, glass density and optical refractive index, as well as glass &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Raman&lt;/a&gt; spectra (a measure of the atomic structure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imelt_structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;i-Melt structure&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;i-Melt is a serialized model that takes in input glass composition, passes it to a deep feed-forward neural network to predict latent and observed variables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i-Melt is built using PyTorch, and the rich flexibility and power of the PyTorch framework are integral to its success. This made it straightforward to develop models that combine physical equations with machine learning, and to explore and test a range of different approaches. We also benefited from the ability to seamlessly switch between GPU and CPU-based computations, allowing us to exploit the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://webpublix.ipgp.fr/rech/scp/&quot;&gt;DANTE computational cluster&lt;/a&gt; at IPGP — University of Paris, equipped with A100 NVidia GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;model-evaluation&quot;&gt;Model evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The i-Melt prototype focuses on glasses made from four ingredients: oxides of sodium, potassium, aluminium and silicon (specifically, Na₂O-K₂O-Al₂O₃-SiO₂ glasses). Within this system, the viscosity of molten glass varies considerably (from -2 to 14 log Paᐧs), and i-Melt successfully predicts this with a precision better than 0.4 log unit. Other properties are also well predicted, including the temperature at which the melt ‘freezes’ into a glass (the glass transition temperature; RMSE test: 19 K), the glass density (RMSE test: 0.02 g cm⁻³) and the optical refractive index (RMSE test: 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imelt_validation.png&quot; alt=&quot;i-Melt validation&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Predicted values with i-Melt versus measurements from the training, validation and testing datasets for viscosity of molten glasses on the left, and the density of glasses at room temperature on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-cases&quot;&gt;Use cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i-Melt has a wide range of potential applications. First, it can be used to help engineer materials with particular properties, and optimize industrial processes. In fact, you can try this out for yourself using i-Melt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://share.streamlit.io/charlesll/i-melt/imelt_streamlit.py&quot;&gt;online interface&lt;/a&gt;, powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlit.io/&quot;&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt;, or using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt/blob/master/Prediction_simple.ipynb&quot;&gt;i-Melt as a library&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, we take a glass with 65 mol% SiO₂, 10 mol% Al₂O₃, 20 mol% Na₂O and 5 mol% K₂O, and see how its properties change change if we substitute 3 mol% Al₂O₃ by 3 mol% K₂O:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/charlesll/22da00103b7f5b09c909654b50656e56.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running the code reveals that this small change in composition barely affects the optical refractive index — which determines the visual appearance of the glass — or its density. However, it significantly reduces the temperature at which the glass can be worked, which could allow manufacturers to reduce the operating temperature of their furnaces by around 10 %. This offers a route towards substantial savings on both energy costs, and CO₂ emissions. Of course, the current version of i-Melt only includes a small number of ‘ingredients’, but future developments will enable us to make calculations for more complex glass compositions (see Perspectives below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use i-Melt to understand volcanoes. Some volcanic eruptions are violently explosive, such as Mt St Helens (U.S.A.) in 1980 or Mt Pinatubo (Philippines) in 1991. However, others (including the 2021 eruptions in La Palma and Iceland) are ‘effusive’: they involve massive lava flows, but no explosions. This difference turns out to be driven by the viscosity (or ‘runniness’) of the molten rock. When the viscosity is low, the lava flows easily, and any gases trapped within the molten rock can readily escape; if the viscosity is high the gas bubbles get trapped, until eventually they explode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cubre_vieja.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cubre Vieja volcano&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Satellite view (Copernicus Sentinel-2) of the Cubre Vieja volcano, La Palma, Canary Islands, taken on 30 September 2021. The behavior of lava flows, and more generally of volcanic eruptions, is determined by the viscosity of the flowing lava. This image has been processed in true colour, using the shortwave infrared channel to highlight the lava flow. Source: European Space Agency, Wikimedia, CC ASA 2.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But viscosity itself is a puzzle: small changes in magma composition seem to have an disproportionately large impact on how the melt behaves. This is particularly true for magma erupted by ‘silicic’ (or silicon-rich) supervolcanoes like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera&quot;&gt;Yellowstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Valley_Caldera&quot;&gt;Long Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and i-Melt points us towards an answer. Our results suggest that as the composition of silicic lava changes, their molecular structure undergoes a sudden transition, organising into a highly-connected network. This atomic connectivity makes the magma more resistant to flow, and it is this that creates a step-change in viscosity. While more work is required to fully understand the processes at work here, scientists at least now have an idea of where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perspectives&quot;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this successful proof-of-concept, we are extending i-Melt to a wider range of compositions, including oxides of magnesium and calcium that are important for both volcanology and glass science — work undertaken by Barbara Baldoni as part of an internship supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://u-paris.fr/diip/&quot;&gt;Data Intelligence Institute of Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Preliminary results will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/886381&quot;&gt;presented at a meeting of the American Geoscience Union&lt;/a&gt; in December, and suggest that performance remains good. In addition to increasing the menu of ‘ingredients’, we hope to be able to include additional physical properties within our predictions. We also hope to exploit PyTorch’s flexibility to explore other machine learning approaches, such as Gaussian Processes — leveraging the capabilities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gpytorch.ai/&quot;&gt;GPyTorch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyro.ai/&quot;&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three-year project aims to develop a new approach for earthquake and tsunami early warning, avoiding many of the limitations currently present in such systems. This will combine machine learning and artificial intelligence with state-of-the-art geophysical modelling, allowing high-quality real-time prediction of seismic hazards with full uncertainty information. Highlighting opportunities at the interface between geoscience and data science, it is hoped this project will stimulate novel approaches, and build Australian research capacity in this area. Expected benefits include improved techniques for geophysical imaging and real-time data analysis, in addition to enhanced capabilities for mitigating the costs associated with seismic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

In it, he demonstrates how prior sampling can be used to implement earthquake early warning within a probabilistic framework, while properly incorporating all the complexities of wave propagation in realistic heterogenenous crustal structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These local crustal structures, and surface topography, can affect seismograms quite considerably. However, complete waveform modelling is extremely computationally expensive (perhaps 100 CPU-hours/earthquake for the frequency- and time-scales used in this paper). Thus, most earthqake early warning applications have been forced to adopt faster, approximate methods that neglect some or all of these effects. However, the prior sampling framework allows us to perform all these expensive calculations in advance. Then, once an earthquake occurs, we can recover probabilistic models for the seismic source—within milliseconds of the relevant data becoming available. Properly accounting for all of the complexities within the waveforms reduces the uncertainties associated with the results, permitting more robust early warning schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite the ever increasing availability of computational power, real-time source inversions based on physical modeling of wave propagation in realistic media remain challenging. We investigate how a nonlinear Bayesian approach based on pattern recognition and synthetic 3-D Green’s functions can be used to rapidly invert strong-motion data for point source parameters by means of a case study for a fault system in the Los Angeles Basin. The probabilistic inverse mapping is represented in compact form by a neural network which yields probability distributions over source parameters. It can therefore be evaluated rapidly and with very moderate CPU and memory requirements. We present a simulated real-time inversion of data for the 2008 Mw 5.4 Chino Hills event. Initial estimates of epicentral location and magnitude are available ∼14 s after origin time. The estimate can be refined as more data arrive: by ∼40 s, fault strike and source depth can also be determined with relatively high certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

I chose ‘Mapping the upper mantle: Three-dimensional modeling of earth structure by inversion of seismic waveforms’, by John Woodhouse and Adam Dziewonski. The original blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sm/2016/08/12/paper-of-the-month-mapping-the-upper-mantle/&quot;&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;, and is reproduced below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice for ‘paper of the month’ is an article that was published when I was only a few weeks old, yet which was also the starting point for my own research career. On my first day as a PhD student, John Woodhouse handed me the source code for a program called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aphetinv&lt;/code&gt;, and told me to ‘see if you can work out what’s what’. Ten years later, I still don’t think I understand all the intricacies of the code, but I have come to appreciate the importance of the science that it underpinned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mapping the upper mantle: Three-dimensional modeling of earth structure by inversion of seismic waveforms” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1029/JB089iB07p05953&quot;&gt;Woodhouse &amp;amp; Dziewonski, 1984&lt;/a&gt;) is one of the cornerstones of modern global tomography. For the first time, John and the late Adam Dziewonski showed how complete seismic waveforms could be used to construct a single image of the entire upper mantle. For most geoscientists today, raised on a diet of such pictures, it is perhaps hard to imagine how much of a revelation this was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, progress in science requires ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’, and imaging the Earth’s interior was not a new idea in 1984. In fact, it can be traced back at least as far as 1861, when Robert Mallet—a Dublin engineer, whose other major contribution to science involved rescuing the Guinness brewery when its water supply dried up&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/108751&quot;&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt; documenting local variations in seismic wavespeed, for the area around the town of Holyhead, in Wales. In 1977, this crystallised into something recognisable to modern seismologists as regional travel-time tomography: &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1029/JB082i002p00277&quot;&gt;Keiiti Aki, Anders Christoffersson and Eyestein Husebye&lt;/a&gt; were able to take P-wave travel times recorded underneath a small seismic array operated by Norsar, and recover seismic velocities in a three-dimensional arrangement of grid cells. The 1970s and 80s also saw much early work mapping global variations in mode eigenfrequencies, or in surface wave phase velocities, and then using these maps to infer details of Earth structure—and of course, 1981 marked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9201(81)90046-7&quot;&gt;publication of PREM&lt;/a&gt;, the ‘preliminary’ reference Earth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woodhouse &amp;amp; Dziewonksi’s work in &lt;em&gt;Mapping the Upper Mantle&lt;/em&gt; built on these ideas, and on their other great joint contribution to global seismology (with George Chou, in 1981): the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1029/JB086iB04p02825&quot;&gt;centroid–moment-tensor algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. This had extended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/74517&quot;&gt;earlier work by Freeman Gilbert&lt;/a&gt; and others, and showed how the mathematical expression for a seismogram as a sum of normal modes could be differentiated with respect to the various source parameters. Thus, these derivatives—nowadays often referred to as ‘sensitivity kernels’—could be used to drive an optimisation procedure which sought to match synthetic waveforms to observations. The logical next step—and the main theoretical contribution within the 1984 paper—was to derive similar expressions for partial derivatives with respect to structural parameters, and then apply the same procedure to obtain images of Earth’s interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this to be computationally tractable, an efficient method for computing synthetic seismograms in laterally heterogeneous earth models was required. A simplifying assumption was introduced: the ‘path-average approximation’. In this framework, seismograms are sensitive only to the average structure encountered along the great-circle ray path between source and receiver. The resulting expression for a synthetic seismogram is very similar to Gilbert’s formula for normal mode summation in spherically-symmetric earth models, except that it has path-dependent perturbations to modal frequencies and source-receiver epicentral distances—and thus it could be implemented with relatively minor modifications to existing codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the mathematical machinery in place, Woodhouse &amp;amp; Dziewonski took data from 870 source-receiver pairs, drawn from the new global networks—the &lt;em&gt;International Deployment of Accelerometers&lt;/em&gt; programme, for example, had begun less than a decade before, in 1975. From the seismograms, handpicked windows were chosen that either contained mantle-sampling surface wave trains (which were filtered to contain signal at periods of 135s or more), or long-period body waves (45s period or longer). The result was some 3500 waveforms, which were used to constrain a degree-8 spherical harmonic model of the shear wave velocity structure in the mantle. In fact, two different models were presented in the paper: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;M84C&lt;/code&gt;, which incorporated prior information about regional crustal structure and was designated as the authors’ ‘preferred’ model, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;M84A&lt;/code&gt;, which was determined entirely based on the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/m84c_stack.png&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;10px&quot; /&gt;  When &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;M84C&lt;/code&gt; (left) is compared&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to current state-of-the-art models, it is clear that Woodhouse &amp;amp; Dziewonski managed to capture the large-scale structure of the Earth with remarkable accuracy. Over the intervening 32 years, the picture has been gradually refined by a succession of models produced by various groups, taking advantage of improvements in data and theory, and—above all—exploiting ever-increasing computational resources. The latest global models employ numerical wave propagation simulations that are (almost) physicially-complete, and are built from massive datasets with a far richer frequency content than those used in 1984. Plainly, the details in images have evolved, and model resolution has improved: the lateral features seen in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;M84C&lt;/code&gt; have a minimum length-scale of around 5000km, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.04969.x&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SEMum&lt;/code&gt;, a recent high-resolution model&lt;/a&gt;, reports robustly-imaged structures that are about 1500km across. However, the large-scale picture has changed little, at least regarding the distribution of heterogeneity. Robust determination of the amplitude of velocity anomalies remains somewhat elusive, and current models have yet to reach a consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is interesting to note that one aspect of seismic tomography has remained fundamentally unchanged over the years: the formulation of the tomographic inverse problem. Progress has certainly been made—for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02453.x&quot;&gt;adjoint methods&lt;/a&gt; provide an elegant and computationally-efficient route towards computing model updates, and offer the potential for exploring Earth at ever-finer scales. Yet just as in 1984, these techniques are based on an iterative, linearised approach towards minimising a relatively simple measure of the difference between synthetic and observed waveforms. Perhaps it is here that the next big development will be born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it that makes this paper such an important milestone? Of course, one answer is that it gave geoscientists new insight into the Earth, but I think there is rather more to it than that. &lt;em&gt;Mapping the Upper Mantle&lt;/em&gt; builds on three distinct strands of scientific development that had been growing rapidly through the 1960s and 70s: data and instrumentation; the theory of seismic wave propagation; and computation, especially numerical linear algebra. By a combination of vision and technical ingenuity&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—plus the good fortune of being in the right place at the right time—Woodhouse &amp;amp; Dziewonski were able to draw all three together, heralding a new era of global seismology as a data-driven, computationally-intensive field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another reason why this paper stands out as a turning point: pretty pictures&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The colour plates accompanying &lt;em&gt;Mapping the Upper Mantle&lt;/em&gt; were groundbreaking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and an immense undertaking—all the software to generate them had to be written from scratch, which apparently took almost as much effort as developing the inversion code itself! Before 1984, papers on Earth structure had typically been illustrated with black-and-white contour plots; since then, colourful depth slices and cross-sections have become ubiquitous. Again, this owes as much to technological advances as to the influence of any one paper. But by using cutting-edge tools to tackle an ambitious question, and then presenting the results in an attractive, eye-catching way, Woodhouse &amp;amp; Dziewonski were able to shape the course of research in the geosciences for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;To those of us who are used to the luxuries of modern code development—optimising compilers, visual debuggers, and readily-available libraries to deal with most of the mundane stuff—it is difficult to over-state the scale of their task. A huge amount of creativity had to be employed to ensure that the software could run within the constraints of available memory, and the inversion algorithm had to assimilate individual seismograms sequentially, since they could only be stored on magnetic tape. As a demonstration of the (lost?) art of creative F77 coding, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aphetinv&lt;/code&gt; is a masterpiece—and, consequently, almost impenetrable. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
