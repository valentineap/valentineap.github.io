We are pleased to announce the release of [`pyprop8`](https://github.com/valentineap/pyprop8), a new open-source Python package for simulating seismic observables! It is designed to be simple to install and use, with no obscure dependencies or copiled code, making it well-suited to use in teaching and outreach settings. Take a look at the [online demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/valentineap/pyprop8/HEAD?labpath=examples%2Fdemo.ipynb)!

The package is described in a brief [paper in the Journal of Open Source Software](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04217), with code and examples available [from GitHub](https://github.com/valentineap/pyprop8). It implements theory developed by [O'Toole and Woodhouse (2011)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/187/3/1516/616302), with source parameter derivatives as described in [O'Toole et al. (2012)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/191/1/257/586793).
