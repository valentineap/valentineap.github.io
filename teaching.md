## Past teaching ##
- **Computational Geosciences: Problem-solving, logical thinking and programming (EMSC4033/EMSC8033)**. A course I developed and taught to Honours and Masters students within the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University (2018-2020). By the end of this course, students should have a basic understanding of the concepts of computer programming, and the Python programming language. The primary goal was to ensure students had the skills required to process, analyse and present their research datasets. The course materials (primarily a series of Jupyter notebooks) [are available on Github](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse).
