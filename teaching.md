At Durham I teach on various programmes including:
- [Master of Data Science](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/g5k823/) (MDS)
- [MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis](https://miscada.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) (MISCADA)
- [BSc Geophysics with Geology](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/f662/)

### Computational Geoscience

Course materials I developed for a final-year undergrad/first-year MSc course in 'Computational Geoscience' are [available on Github](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse), and can be previewed [using Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse/binder?labpath=index.ipynb).

### pyprop8

I developed [pyprop8](https://github.com/valentineap/pyprop8) to provide a simple, easy-to-install seismogram simulation package to support teaching. Again, you can [try it out](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/valentineap/pyprop8/HEAD?labpath=examples%2Fdemo.ipynb) online.
