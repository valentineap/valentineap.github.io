My research centres on **geophysical inversion and inference**: the mathematical ideas that allow us to understand the Earth's current state and its evolution across geological time, using the limited information that can be obtained from the Earth's surface and at the present day. I develop tools and techniques that allow us to address geoscience questions more robustly, by enabling better-targeted analysis, and by providing more rigorous constraint on the uncertainties and unknowns associated with results. A brief summary of my work can be found [here](/research/research_statement.html), or you can explore various (overlapping!) themes below.
