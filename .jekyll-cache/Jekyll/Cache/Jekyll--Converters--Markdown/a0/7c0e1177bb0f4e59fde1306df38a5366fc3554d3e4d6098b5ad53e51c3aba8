<h2 id="undergraduates">Undergraduates</h2>
<p>Level 3 and Level 4 dissertation projects are available for Durham undergraduates; please see the list distributed by the module convenor, or <a href="mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk">contact me</a>. I am always happy to hear from Durham undergraduates who are keen to get involved in our research.</p>

<h2 id="masters-students">Masters students</h2>

<p>I offer research projects in the context of three Masters-level programmes run by Durham University:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://miscada.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/">MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis</a> (MISCADA) â€” A one-year taught Masters, aimed at students with highly-numerate first degrees. A research project must be completed as part of this course.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/science.faculty/mds/">MSc in Data Science</a> (MDS) â€” A one-year taught Masters, suitable for quantitively-minded students whose first degrees are not necessarily in numerate subjects. A research project must be completed as part of this course.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/msc-in-computation-geoscience/">MSc by Research</a> (MScR) â€” A one-year research degree. If none of my advertised projects match your interests, you are welcome to <a href="mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk">contact me</a> to discuss other possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not have funding to offer financial support to students following these courses. Various scholarships are available: see the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/">Department of Earth Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/">University</a> websites for more details.</p>

<p>I cannot provide any financial support, except as detailed above. Various organisations in the UK and overseas offer scholarships for PhD studies, and I am always happy to hear from students who have secured one of these, or are contemplating making an application. Please <a href="mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk">contact me</a> to discuss possible projects. Further information about costs and some potential sources of funding can be found on the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/">Durham University website</a>, and information specific to the Department of Earth Sciences <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/">can be found here</a>.</p>

Unfortunately, we can only consider applicants who already have the right to live and work in Australia.</li>
