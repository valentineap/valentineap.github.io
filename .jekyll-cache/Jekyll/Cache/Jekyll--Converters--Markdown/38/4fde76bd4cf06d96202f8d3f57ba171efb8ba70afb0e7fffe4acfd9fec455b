<p>My research looks at how we can make best use of observational data to understand the detailed properties of the Earth and its systems. Many of these systems cannot be directly observed: they may be deep underground, far in the past, or at temperatures and pressures too extreme to be replicated in a lab. How do we learn about them using whatever information we can collect at the Earthâ€™s surface, and at the present day?</p>
