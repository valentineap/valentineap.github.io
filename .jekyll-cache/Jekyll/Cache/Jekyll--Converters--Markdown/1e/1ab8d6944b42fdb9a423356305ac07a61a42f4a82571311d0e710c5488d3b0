I"Í<!-- ## MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis ##
The Durham University [MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis (MISCADA)](https://miscada.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/) is designed for students with quantitative first degrees, and an interest in how mathematical and computational tools can be used to address scientific questions. From October 2021, we are offering a new specialisation within this programme: **Earth & Environment**. In addition to gaining cutting-edge technical skills, students will have opportunities to learn about, and work on, a wide variety of geoscience datasets and applications.

Applications for this programme can be made [via the online portal](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/). Information about fees, living costs, and scholarships can be found [here](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/finance/).

Within this programme I will be teaching:
- Tools: Forward and inverse models
- Applications: Geophysics

## CPD courses
I have designed and delivered high-quality CPD courses covering a range of mathematical, statistical and computational topics relevant to geoscience industry. Please [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk) if you wish to discuss how I can help your organisation.

## Past teaching ##
Courses I have previously been involved with include:
- **Computational Geosciences: Problem-solving, logical thinking and programming (EMSC4033/EMSC8033)**. A course I developed and taught to Honours and Masters students within the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University (2018-2020). By the end of this course, students should have a basic understanding of the concepts of computer programming, and the Python programming language. The primary goal was to ensure students had the skills required to process, analyse and present their research datasets. The course materials (primarily a series of Jupyter notebooks) [are available on Github](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse). -->
