## Undergraduates ##
Level 3 and Level 4 dissertation projects are available for Durham undergraduates; please see the list distributed by the module convenor, or [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk). I am always happy to hear from Durham undergraduates who are keen to get involved in our research.

# Masters students #
I offer research projects in the context of three Masters-level programmes run by Durham University:

- [MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis](https://miscada.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/) (MISCADA) &mdash; A one-year taught Masters, aimed at students with highly-numerate first degrees. A research project must be completed as part of this course.
<!-- {: style="background: LightGray"} -->

- [MSc in Data Science](https://www.dur.ac.uk/science.faculty/mds/) (MDS) &mdash; A one-year taught Masters, suitable for quantitively-minded students whose first degrees are not necessarily in numerate subjects. A research project must be completed as part of this course.
- [MSc by Research](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/msc-in-computation-geoscience/) (MScR) &mdash; A one-year research degree. If none of my advertised projects match your interests, you are welcome to [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk) to discuss other possibilities.

Unfortunately, I do not have funding to offer financial support to students following these courses. Various scholarships are available: see the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/) and [University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/) websites for more details.

- *Unfortunately, there are no positions advertised at present*

I cannot provide any financial support, except as detailed above. Various organisations in the UK and overseas offer scholarships for PhD studies, and I am always happy to hear from students who have secured one of these, or are contemplating making an application. Please [contact me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk) to discuss possible projects. Further information about costs and some potential sources of funding can be found on the [Durham University website](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/), and information specific to the Department of Earth Sciences [can be found here](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/earth-sciences/postgraduate-study/).

# Postdocs and other staff #
We are currently recruiting for:
- [Scientific programmer](https://jobs.anu.edu.au/cw/en/job/540441/scientific-programmer) &mdash; *Closing date: 14 June 2021* &mdash; This position is based at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Unfortunately, we can only consider applicants who already have the right to live and work in Australia.

I am always very happy to hear from early career researchers who are considering applying for their own funding and who might be interested in coming to Durham to work with me.
